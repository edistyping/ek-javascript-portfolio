* Scrollable
* Parallax

To Do
- Decide which projects will go on here
    - For old projects, just create a docx file for explanation

- Might replace About page for Contact page 

1. Make a horizontal slide for each section
    => Carousel again?

2. Update Projects - Carousels for formatting 



// Grand Plan
1. Header
    - Include each Section below
    
2. Home
    - Hello and Name, Email, Skills
    - Make texts appear like Drone 

3. Projects
    - Grid: 3 in only one row 
    - Additional projects will be slide on click

4. About Me
    - Intro, Experience, Fun Pictures
    - My favorite Quotes, musics, and movies 

5. Contacts (Back to Header) 



# Access sqlite3 
sqlite3  db.sqlite3
.tables
w.headers on
select * from projects_project;

Features
1. Scrollable 
    - Section and Link?
    
2. Parallax Template
    - Background. 

4. For Home, make texts appear like in Matrix 

2. Scrolling will make it go left or right
    => Can this be done
    => Cancelled. This hurts the eye actually especially carouseling a large display
